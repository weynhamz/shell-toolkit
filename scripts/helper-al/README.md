Helpers for Arch Linux Maintanance
==================================

These are several scripts I wrote to help maintain the system.

* **epacman**

    Filter and view information of the installed packages.

* **logsplit**

    Clean and manage Arch Linux log files.

* **makepkg**

    This is a wrapper for makepkg which will build the PKGBUILD in a
    subdirectory named after package's name in the building directory.
